# Key Binds

Key Binds allow you to map user input (Triggers) to one or more operations (Actions).

## Triggers

A trigger is the event that activates a binding. Matchmaker supports keyboard, mouse, and semantic aliases.

### Keyboard

Standard key names and combinations are supported. Matchmaker uses a very human format:

- **Single Keys**: `enter`, `esc`, `space`, `tab`, `backspace`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `home`, `end`, `f1` through `f12`.
- **Characters**: `a`, `b`, `c`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `?`, `/`, etc.
- **Modifiers**: `ctrl-`, `alt-`, `shift-`, `super-` (e.g., `ctrl-c`, `alt-enter`, `shift-up`).
- **Combinations**: `ctrl-alt-del`.

Get your key name with `mm --test-keys`.

**Example:**
`ctrl-s = "Select"` (Bind Ctrl+S to the Select action)

### Mouse

The following mouse events can be bound:

- **Buttons**: `left`, `middle`, `right`.
- **Scrolling**: `scrollup`, `scrolldown`, `scrollleft`, `scrollright`.
- **Modifiers**: `ctrl+left`, `alt+scrollup`, `shift+right`.

Modifiers can be specified but are not supported due to a library limitation.

**Example:**
`scrollup = "Up(1)"` (Bind ScrollUp to move the cursor up 1 line)

### Semantic Triggers

Semantic triggers (prefixed with `@`) act as named aliases. They allow you to define a sequence of operations once and trigger it from multiple keys or events, or even from other actions.

**Allowed Characters:**
Semantic trigger names (the part after `@`) can contain:

- Alphanumeric characters
- Spaces
- `-`, `_`, `.`, `:`, `/`, `+`, `@`, `$`

**Defining a Semantic Trigger:**

You define a semantic trigger by binding it to one or more actions in your configuration:

```toml
[binds]
"@my_macro" = [
    "ExecuteSilent(echo 'Starting...')",
    "Filtering(true)",
    "SetPrompt(working> )",
]
```

**Using a Semantic Trigger:**

This trigger then becomes a valid action:

```toml
[binds]
"ctrl-x" = "@my_macro"
"Start" = "@my_macro"
```

When sharing a command-line matchmaker command, you can also define your actions using these semantic triggers, allowing consumers to use their preferred binds for similar actions across different applications.

*Note: You can also dynamically rebind semantic triggers at runtime using the `Bind` action. For an advanced example, scroll to the bottom.*

**Predefined Semantic Triggers:**

`@next` and `@prev` are will resolve to the following defaults unless you (or a preset) redefine them:

```toml
[binds]
# cycle through the reload commands in `start.additional_commands`
"@next" = ["ReloadNext", "Cancel"]
"@prev" = ["ReloadPrev", "Cancel"]
```

### Events

Actions can be bound to events:

#### Lifecycle

- `Start` – Triggered when the application starts.
- `Complete` – Triggered when the application is about to exit.
- `Synced` – Triggered when the matcher completes its first synchronization.
- `Resynced` – Triggered when the matcher finishes processing the current state again.
- `Reloaded` – Triggered when a `Reload` or `ReloadNext` action begins.
- `Restarted` - Triggered when the matcher starts running again.

#### Input & Cursor

- `QueryChange` – Triggered whenever the input query changes.
- `CursorChange` – Triggered when the selection cursor moves.

#### Preview & Overlay

- `PreviewChange` – Triggered when the preview content updates.
- `PreviewSet` – Triggered when preview content is explicitly set.
- `OverlayChange` – Triggered when the overlay content changes.
- `PreviewStarted` - When the preview command for a result starts running.
- `PreviewFinished` - When a preview finishes.

#### Window

- `Resize` – Triggered when the terminal window is resized.
- `Refresh` – Triggered when a full UI redraw occurs.

#### Control

- `Pause` – Triggered when the system enters a paused state.
- `Resume` – Triggered when execution resumes from a paused state.

### Modes

Triggers can be optionally prefixed with a mode pattern followed by `^^`. A bind with a mode will only be active when the current application mode matches the pattern.

**Syntax:** `mode_pattern^^trigger = actions`

The mode pattern uses a prefix-based filter:

- **Positive prefixes** (e.g., `0`, `vim`): The current mode must contain a tag starting with this prefix.
- **Negative prefixes** (e.g., `!0`, `!piped`): The current mode must NOT contain a tag starting with this prefix.
- Multiple prefixes are separated by commas and all must match (AND logic).
- An empty pattern matches every mode.

**Example:**

```toml
[binds]
"vim^^h" = "BackwardChar"
"vim^^l" = "ForwardChar"
"h" = "Up"
"l" = "Down"
```

In this example, if the mode is `vim`, `h` and `l` will move the cursor horizontally. In any other mode, they will move the selection cursor vertically.

**More complex examples:**

```toml
[binds]
# Only active when both stdin and stdout are terminals
"0,1^^enter" = "Accept"

# Active in any mode EXCEPT when stdin is a terminal
"!0^^esc" = "Quit(1)"

# Active when mode contains "vim" but not "insert"
"vim,!insert^^h" = "BackwardChar"
```

Binds defined without a mode act as fallbacks and are active in all modes unless overridden by a mode-specific bind.

Matchmaker initializes with a default mode based on how it was started. The mode is a comma-separated list of tags:

- `0,1`: Both stdin and stdout are connected to a terminal (full TTY).
- `0`: Only stdin is connected to a terminal (input is interactive, output is piped).
- `1`: Only stdout is connected to a terminal (input is piped, output is interactive).
- `""` (empty): Neither input nor output are connected to a terminal (fully piped).

You can set the initial mode using `start.mode`.

| `@name`                | Execute the actions associated with semantic trigger `name`.                                                                        |
| `#description`         | Add a description-only trace action for help/debug output.                                                                          |

- `ToggleExitFirst([bool])`: Toggle or set the exit-on-one-match behavior.

Note: Commands executed via these actions have access to various [environment variables](12-templates.md#environment-variables). CLI command actions use the configured `start.shell`; an empty shell uses `$SHELL` (falling back to `/bin/sh`). A command beginning with `@` for `Execute`, `ExecuteAsync`, `ExecuteThen`, `ExecuteSilent`, `Become`, or `BecomeSilent` treats the first word as a script path relative to the parent of `MM_OVERRIDE` (absolute paths are also accepted) and passes the remaining words as arguments without shell parsing.

## Sequences and CLI

Multiple actions can be executed in sequence by using an array:

- **TOML**: `ctrl-x = ["Cancel", "Reload"]`
- **CLI**: `mm b "ctrl-x=Cancel,Reload"`

### CLI Overrides

When overriding binds from the command line, use the `b` (or `binds`) prefix:

```bash
# Bind a single action:
mm b 'alt-enter=Accept'

# Some action parameters are optional
mm b.ctrl-q 'SwitchPreview' # toggle preview
mm b.ctrl-q 'SwitchPreview(2)' # toggle preview layout 2
```

#### Advanced Example: Switching between Ripgrep and MM

You can mimic `fzf`'s [ripgrep example](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md) as follows:

```toml
[query]
prompt_style.fg = "Red"

[matcher]
ansi = true

[start]
command = 'rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case "$FZF_QUERY"'

[binds]
"Start" = "@enter_rg"
"@enter_rg" = [ # Reload on query change, disable reparsing, update bind
    "Filtering(false)",
    '''Bind(QueryChange = Reload)''',
    # Prompt indicator (
    '''Transform(
    [[ -n "$MM_QUERY" ]] &&
    prompt="($MM_QUERY)" ||
    prompt="rg>"

    echo "SetPrompt($prompt )"
    echo "SetQuery($MM_STORE)"
    echo "Store($MM_QUERY)"
)''',
    "Bind(@reload = @enter_mm)",
]
"@enter_mm" = [
    "Filtering(true)",
    "Unbind(QueryChange)",
    '''Transform(
 [[ -n "$MM_QUERY" ]] &&
 prompt="($MM_QUERY)" ||
 prompt="mm"

    echo "SetPrompt({blue,italic:$prompt })"
    echo "SetQuery($MM_STORE)"
    echo "Store($MM_QUERY)"
)
''',
    "Bind(@reload = @enter_rg)",
]

"ctrl-r" = "@reload"
```

This example is simplified to demonstrate the special actions `Bind`, `Store`, `Transform`, and `Semantic`. You can find the full version at <https://github.com/Squirreljetpack/matchmaker/blob/main/matchmaker-cli/assets/presets/rg.toml>
